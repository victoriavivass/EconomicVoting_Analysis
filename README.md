## Project Description
This project investigates the theoretical and empirical dimensions of retrospective economic voting, focusing on the Spanish electoral context from 2018 to 2023. It tests two key hypotheses:
1. Economic evaluations are less ideologically biased during recessions.
2. Economic voting diminishes in times of economic crises.

The analysis uses post-electoral survey data from the Spanish National Center for Sociological Research (CIS) to explore how macroeconomic contexts impact voter accountability and ideological biases.
