# Economic Voting in Times of Crisis

This repository contains the R code, data, and resources for the bachelor thesis  
**"Economic Voting in Times of Crisis"** by **María Victoria Vivas Gutiérrez**.  

The project examines how economic perceptions influence voting behavior in Spain (2018–2023),  
with a focus on periods of economic crisis.

## Project Description
This project investigates the theoretical and empirical dimensions of **retrospective economic voting**,  
focusing on the Spanish electoral context from **2018 to 2023**.  

It tests two key hypotheses:

1. Economic evaluations are less ideologically biased during recessions.  
2. Economic voting diminishes in times of economic crises.  

The analysis uses **post-electoral survey data** from the *Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS)*  
to explore how macroeconomic contexts affect voter accountability and ideological biases.

## Installation and Usage
### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/victoriavivass/EconomicVoting_Analysis.git
cd EconomicVoting_Analysis
```
### 2. Open the project in RStudio

Open the `.Rproj` file `(EconomicVoting_Analysis.Rproj)` to load the project.
This ensures that relative paths (like `data/raw/...`) work correctly.

### 3. Run the pipeline

In the RStudio console, run:
```
source("src/main.R")
out <- run()
```
Cleaned datasets are returned in memory (`out$csv` and `out$sav`).
Plots are saved automatically in the `plots`/ folder.
Models are saved as `.rds` files in the `models`/ folder.

### 4. Make sure you have the following R packages installed:

```
packages <- c(
  "ggplot2", "dplyr", "haven", "naniar", "MASS",
  "cowplot", "stargazer", "margins", "purrr"
)
install.packages(packages)
```
