## Project Description
This project investigates the theoretical and empirical dimensions of **retrospective economic voting**,  
focusing on the Spanish electoral context from **2018 to 2023**.  

It tests two key hypotheses:

1. Economic evaluations are less ideologically biased during recessions.  
2. Economic voting diminishes in times of economic crises.  

The analysis uses **post-electoral survey data** from the *Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS)*  
to explore how macroeconomic contexts affect voter accountability and ideological biases.
